//You scrape petango and you get one pet object back.
//You want to look that pet up in your database by animalId.
//If the pet does not exsist you want to insert and save in database.
//If the pet does not exsist in the scrape but exsists in the DB we want to
//remove or hide the pet.
//If the the pet exsits in both the scrape and the database, update data.
